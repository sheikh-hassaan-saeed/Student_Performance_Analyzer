## 🧠 Why This Project?

Though written in C++, this project follows the habits you'd expect from a frontend engineer who cares about user experience at every level.

Even in the terminal, design matters. This app mimics backend logic (input, processing, reporting), but with the same attention to UX you'd see in web dashboards.
